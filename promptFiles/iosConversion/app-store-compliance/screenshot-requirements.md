## üéØ Best Practices

### Visual Design

**Do**:

- ‚úÖ Use real data (real restaurant names, photos)
- ‚úÖ Show feature benefits clearly
- ‚úÖ Use your actual app UI (not mockups)
- ‚úÖ Consistent status bar (9:41 AM, full signal, full battery)
- ‚úÖ Same theme throughout (all light or all dark)
- ‚úÖ Device frames (makes it look professional)

**Don't**:

- ‚ùå Use placeholder data ("Lorem ipsum", "Test Restaurant")
- ‚ùå Mix light and dark mode screenshots
- ‚ùå Show error states or broken UI
- ‚ùå Include personal user data
- ‚ùå Show beta/debug features

### Text Overlays (Optional)

Can add text to highlight features:

**Example**:

```
Screenshot 1: "Sign in with Apple for Privacy"
Screenshot 2: "Save Your Favorite Restaurants"
Screenshot 3: "Discover New Places Nearby"
Screenshot 4: "Vote with Friends on Where to Eat"
Screenshot 5: "Let Us Decide for You"
```

**Guidelines**:

- Keep text minimal
- Use large, readable font
- Match your brand colors
- Don't obstruct important UI
- Apple recommends against excessive text
