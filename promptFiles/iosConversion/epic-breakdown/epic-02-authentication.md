    @Published var isLoading = false
    @Published var error: String?

    func signIn(email: String, password: String) async {
        isLoading = true
        defer { isLoading = false }

        do {
            let signIn = try await Clerk.shared.client.signIns.create(
                strategy: .identifier(email, password: password)
            )

            guard let token = signIn.createdSessionId else {

        }
    }

    private func handleSuccessfulAuth(token: String) async throws {
        try KeychainManager.shared.save(token: token)
        let user: User = try await APIService.shared.get(.currentUser)

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue**: "Sign in with Apple not working on simulator"

- **Solution**: Must test on physical device. Simulator has limited support.

**Issue**: "Clerk says user not found"

- **Solution**: Ensure web app Sign in with Apple is configured identically.

**Issue**: "Token expires too quickly"

- **Solution**: Implement token refresh logic in AuthViewModel.

**Issue**: "Face ID not prompting"

- **Solution**: Add NSFaceIDUsageDescription to Info.plist.
