**Code Example**:

```swift
// Features/Decisions/ViewModels/DecisionViewModel.swift
@MainActor
class DecisionViewModel: ObservableObject {
    @Published var selectedRestaurant: Restaurant?
    @Published var isAnimating = false

    private let service = DecisionService()

    func pickRandom(from collection: Collection) async {
        isAnimating = true

        do {
            // Get restaurants with weights
            let decision: Decision = try await service.createPersonalDecision(
                collectionId: collection.id,
                method: .random,
                visitDate: Date()
            )

            // Animate for 2 seconds
            try await Task.sleep(nanoseconds: 2_000_000_000)

            // Show result
            if let resultId = decision.result?.restaurantId,
               let restaurant = collection.restaurants?.first(where: { $0.id == resultId }) {
                selectedRestaurant = restaurant
                Haptics.success()
            }
        } catch {

## üêõ Common Issues

**Issue**: "Drag-and-drop not working in simulator"

- **Solution**: Test on physical device, use mouse drag carefully in simulator.

**Issue**: "Weights not updating"

- **Solution**: Check mobile API decision history endpoint, verify 30-day calculation.

**Issue**: "Notifications not received"

- **Solution**: Check FCM token registration, verify backend sending notifications.
