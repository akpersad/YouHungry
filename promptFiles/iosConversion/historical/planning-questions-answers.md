# iOS Conversion Planning - Complete Q&A History

Historical record of all planning questions and answers that shaped the iOS conversion strategy.

**Date**: October 21, 2025
**Rounds**: 3 rounds of clarifying questions
**Outcome**: Complete iOS documentation suite created

---

## üéØ Round 1: Core Decisions

### 1. iOS Development Framework

**Question**: Which approach do you want to take?

**Answer**: **Native Swift with SwiftUI**

**Rationale**: Best performance, full iOS features, proper App Store submission. Will create Apple Developer account and submit to App Store. Need adherence to App Store guidelines.

**Impact**: Determined entire technical stack and approach.

---

### 2. iOS Version Support

**Question**: What's the minimum iOS version to support?

**Answer**: **iOS 16+ minimum, optimized for iOS 26**

**Key Insight**: iOS 26 introduces **Liquid Glass** design language (translucent controls, fluid UI, dynamic design). This is critical for design system.

**Impact**: Design system must blend Liquid Glass + Neumorphism.

---

### 3. Authentication Strategy

**Question**: How should users sign in on iOS?

**Answer**: **Same credentials work on web and iOS seamlessly (Clerk)**

**Clarification**: Users should not need two different logins. One account, works everywhere.

**Impact**: Clerk iOS SDK + cross-platform account syncing.

---

### 4. Development Experience

**Question**: What's your iOS development background?

**Answer**: **Some iOS experience, mostly web (B)**

**Key Note**: Most conversion work done by AI, human handles review/adjustments.

**Impact**: Documentation optimized for AI consumption, full code generation with detailed comments.

---

### 5. Backend API Changes

**Question**: Should we create separate mobile API or use existing web API?

**Answer**: **Open to what makes technical sense**

**Concern**: "If web APIs go down, everything goes down - does that matter?"

**Decision**: Create dedicated mobile API (resilience, no single point of failure).

**Impact**: Determined backend architecture - separate mobile API on Render.

---

### 6. Timeline & Scope

**Question**: What's your goal for the iOS app?

**Answer**: **Full parity with web app**

**Clarification**: Development in phases (epics + stories), note which can be done in parallel.

**Impact**: 11 epics mirroring web app structure.

---

### 7. Data Sync & Cross-Platform

**Question**: How should data sync work?

**Answer**: **Same backend, automatic sync (D)**

**Rationale**: Most data retrieved through APIs, makes cross-platform possible.

**Impact**: Shared MongoDB backend, API-based sync.

---

### 8. Push Notifications

**Question**: How should push notifications work?

**Answer**: **All of the above (D)** - APNs + SMS + Email + In-App

**Preference**: Push notifications will be primary ("king"), others as backup.

**Impact**: Multi-channel notification system with Firebase Cloud Messaging.

---

### 9. Offline Functionality

**Question**: How should offline work?

**Answer**: **Partial offline support**

**Clarification**: Don't need full offline, but users should access some features offline.

**Impact**: Selective offline features, Core Data caching.

---

### 10. Design System & UI

**Question**: How should the iOS app look?

**Answer**: **Hybrid approach** - neumorphism + native iOS

**Specific**: "Lean into neumorphism, but take advantage of native iOS where it makes sense. Like nav groups - we built custom on mobile, but even more seamless version exists in iOS."

**Impact**: Liquid Glass for system UI, Neumorphism for brand identity.

---

## üîç Round 2: Critical Clarifications

### Question 1: Sign in with Apple Requirement (CRITICAL)

**Context**: Apple REQUIRES "Sign in with Apple" if offering any third-party/social login.

**Answer**: **Yes, let's go with Option B**

**Implementation**: Clerk as primary backend + "Sign in with Apple" button. When users sign in with Apple, create/link Clerk account behind the scenes.

**Follow-up Question**: "Walk me through what I'd need to do in Clerk. Also, do we need to update the web app?"

**Answer**: Yes, web app needs Sign in with Apple too (for consistency). Documented in Web App Epic 11.

**Clarification**: "Is it like a social login where users can choose?"

**Confirmed**: YES - users choose. Sign in with Apple is OPTIONAL, not required. Apple's guideline just requires it's AVAILABLE.

---

### Question 2: iOS 26 & Liquid Glass Design

**Context**: iOS 26 introduces Liquid Glass design language.

**Answer**: **Option B - Liquid Glass for system controls, Neumorphism for brand**

**Specific Decisions**:

1. **App Icons**: Clear look (iOS 26 style)
2. **Navigation**: Native iOS 26 nav bars
3. **Buttons**: Liquid Glass translucent
4. **Cards**: Blend Liquid Glass refraction + neumorphic depth ‚úÖ

**Request**: "YES please" to detailed design system mapping showing how to blend both.

**Impact**: Created comprehensive design system documentation blending both styles.

---

### Question 3: API Architecture (CRITICAL)

**Context**: Concern about single point of failure.

**Answer**: **Option B - Dedicated Mobile API**

**Rationale**: "Especially if it means app reviewers will like this route better. Plus no one point of failure."

**Impact**:

- Mobile API on Render (separate from Vercel)
- Resilience (web can go down, mobile stays up)
- App Store reviewers prefer dedicated mobile infrastructure

---

### Question 4: Clerk iOS Integration

**Answer**: **Option A - Clerk iOS SDK + Sign in with Apple**

**Clarification**: "If you recommend A, let's do it."

**Follow-up**: Asked if web app needs updates.

**Confirmed**: YES - Web App Epic 11 created with pre-iOS tasks:

1. Add Sign in with Apple to web
2. API documentation
3. Privacy Policy updates
4. Backend prep for mobile API

---

### Question 5: Epic Structure

**Answer**: **This works** - phased approach good

**Key Requirement**: "Make sure you note which stories can be done in tandem."

**Impact**: All epic docs include "Parallel Work Groups" sections.

---

### Question 6: Offline Features

**Initial**: Only checked 3 features (history, groups, create collections)

**Clarification**: **Oversight** - wants collections/restaurants viewable offline too

**Final List** (all checked):

- ‚úÖ View previously loaded collections + restaurants
- ‚úÖ Browse restaurant details from cache
- ‚úÖ View decision history
- ‚úÖ View groups
- ‚úÖ Create collections offline (sync when online)
- ‚úÖ View map locations from cache

**Impact**: Comprehensive offline strategy in agent guide 06.
