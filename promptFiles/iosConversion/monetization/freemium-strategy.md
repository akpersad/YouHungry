# Freemium Strategy

Complete monetization strategy for Fork In The Road iOS app.

---

## 🎯 Freemium Model Overview

**Philosophy**: Give users enough value for free to get hooked, charge for power features.

**Target Conversion**: 5-8% free → premium (industry standard for social apps)

**Pricing**:

- **Launch Price** (first year): $0.99/month, $10/year
- **Regular Price** (year 2+): $3.99/month, $39.99/year
- **Premium+ Future** (optional): $9.99/month

## 🆓 Free Tier (Generous)

### What's Included

**Core Functionality** (Users can use app meaningfully):

- ✅ **10 personal collections** (enough for most users)
- ✅ **Restaurant search and discovery** (unlimited)
- ✅ **Basic personal decision making** (random selection)
- ✅ **Join up to 3 groups** (social features accessible)
- ✅ **Participate in group decisions** (random only, not tiered voting)
- ✅ **View decision history** (last 30 days)
- ✅ **Push notifications** (essential for group features)
- ✅ **Email notifications** (communication channel)
- ✅ **In-app notifications** (always available)

**Why These Limits**:

- **10 collections**: Enough for casual users (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Date Night, etc.)
- **3 groups**: Can try social features without overwhelming
- **30-day history**: See recent patterns, want more? Upgrade.
- **Random only**: Taste of group decisions, want fairness? Upgrade to tiered voting.

### Free Tier Trade-Offs

**What Free Users See**:

- ⚠️ **Bottom banner ads** (non-intrusive, clearly labeled)
- ⚠️ **Upgrade prompts** (when hitting limits, soft reminders)

**Psychology**: Free tier is GOOD ENOUGH for casual users but leaves power users wanting more.

## 💡 Feature Gating Strategy

### Hard Limits (Can't Use Feature)

**Free Tier Limits**:

- **11th collection**: Paywall, can't create without upgrade
- **4th group**: Paywall, can't join without upgrade
- **31+ day history**: Paywall, can't view without upgrade
- **Tiered voting**: Paywall, can't vote (only view results)

**UX**: Show clear upgrade prompt when limit reached

### Soft Prompts (Can Still Use, But Reminded)

**Free Tier Reminders**:

- **Banner** at bottom of restaurant search: "Upgrade for advanced filters"
- **Toast** after 3rd group joined: "Premium unlocks unlimited groups!"
- **Modal** on 10th collection: "One more left! Upgrade for unlimited"

**UX**: Non-intrusive, but present

## 📈 Revenue Projections

### Conservative Model

- **After Apple's cut (30%)**: ~$245 profit

**Year 2** (Raise to $3.99/month):

- 5,000 users
