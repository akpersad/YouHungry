# Certificate & Provisioning Profile Management

Guide to understanding and managing iOS code signing certificates and provisioning profiles.

---

## üéØ Overview

**Code Signing** is Apple's way of ensuring apps are from trusted developers and haven't been tampered with.

**Key Concepts**:

- **Certificate**: Proves you're a registered developer
- **Provisioning Profile**: Links certificate + App ID + devices
- **Bundle Identifier**: Unique ID for your app (e.g., `com.forkintheroad.app`)

**Good News**: Xcode handles most of this automatically with "Automatically manage signing" ‚úÖ

---

## üîê Certificate Types

### Development Certificate

**Purpose**: Run app on physical devices during development
**Who Needs**: Everyone on the development team
**Device Limit**: 100 devices per year per developer account

### Distribution Certificate

**Purpose**: Submit app to TestFlight and App Store
**Who Needs**: Only account holder (you)
**Device Limit**: No limit (distributed via App Store/TestFlight)

### Push Notification Certificate (APNs)

**Purpose**: Send push notifications to app
**Setup**: Done in Apple Developer portal + Firebase console
**Required**: For push notifications feature (Epic 6)

---

## üöÄ Automatic Signing (Recommended)

### Enable Automatic Signing

1. **Open Project in Xcode**
2. **Select Project** (blue YouHungry icon in Navigator)
3. **Select Target** ‚Üí YouHungry
4. **Go to "Signing & Capabilities" tab**
5. **Check "Automatically manage signing"** ‚úÖ
6. **Team**: Select your Apple ID
7. **Bundle Identifier**: `com.forkintheroad.app`

**What Xcode Does Automatically**:

- Creates development certificate (if needed)
- Creates provisioning profiles
- Renews expired certificates
- Downloads profiles when needed
- Updates profiles when capabilities change

### Automatic Signing Handles

‚úÖ Development builds
‚úÖ Running on simulator
‚úÖ Running on your physical device
‚úÖ TestFlight builds
‚úÖ App Store builds

**This is the recommended approach for solo developers!**

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### "Provisioning profile doesn't match"

**Solution**:

1. Xcode ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Accounts
2. Select your Apple ID
3. Click "Download Manual Profiles"
4. Try building again

### "Code signing certificate not found"

**Solution**:

1. Keychain Access ‚Üí Certificates
2. Look for "Apple Development" or "Apple Distribution"
3. If missing: Xcode ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Accounts ‚Üí Manage Certificates ‚Üí + ‚Üí Apple Development
4. If expired: Delete old certificate, create new one

## üîí Security Best Practices

### Protect Your Certificates

1. **Never share private keys**

   - Certificates in Keychain are paired with private keys
   - If compromised, revoke immediately

2. **Use automatic signing when possible**

   - Less chance of errors
   - Xcode handles renewals

3. **Backup certificates**

   - Export from Keychain (with password)
   - Store securely (not in version control!)

4. **Revoke compromised certificates**
   - Developer portal ‚Üí Certificates ‚Üí Revoke
   - Create new ones immediately

### Team Sharing (If You Add Team Members Later)

**For CI/CD or Team Development**:

1. Create a "shared" Apple ID for code signing
2. Generate certificates under that ID
3. Share certificates securely (encrypted)
4. Use match or fastlane for team signing

**For this project**: You're solo, so automatic signing is perfect!
