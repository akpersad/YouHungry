# Post-Deployment Setup Guide - You Hungry? App

This document outlines the steps required to complete the production setup **after** deploying the You Hungry? app to Vercel.

> **Note**: Make sure you've completed the [Pre-Deployment Checklist](./pre-deployment.md) before following this guide.

## üöÄ Prerequisites

- [ ] App deployed to Vercel
- [ ] Production domain configured and accessible
- [ ] Pre-deployment environment variables already set
- [ ] Live URL available (e.g., `https://your-app.vercel.app`)

## üîß Post-Deployment Environment Variables

These variables require the live URL and must be set after deployment:

### URL-Dependent Environment Variables

Set these in your Vercel project dashboard under Settings > Environment Variables:

```bash
# App Configuration (requires live URL)
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://your-app.vercel.app

# Clerk Production Keys (requires live URL for webhook)
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_...
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...
CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...

# Google Analytics 4 (requires production URL)
NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX
```

### Environment Variable Notes

- **Clerk Keys**: Switch from `pk_test_` and `sk_test_` to `pk_live_` and `sk_live_` for production
- **App URL**: Must be set to your actual Vercel domain or custom domain
- **Webhook Secret**: Generated after setting up Clerk webhook with live URL
- **GA4 Measurement ID**: Create GA4 property with production URL to get measurement ID

## üîó Clerk Webhook Setup

### Step 1: Access Clerk Dashboard

1. Go to [https://dashboard.clerk.com](https://dashboard.clerk.com)
2. Sign in to your Clerk account
3. Select your project

> **Note**: This guide assumes you're using Clerk v5. If you're using an older version, the webhook setup may differ slightly.

### Step 2: Navigate to Webhooks

1. In the left sidebar, click **"Webhooks"**
2. Click **"Add Endpoint"**

### Step 3: Configure Webhook

1. **Endpoint URL**: `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/webhooks/clerk`
2. **Events to Subscribe**:
   - `user.created`
   - `user.updated`
   - `user.deleted`
3. Click **"Create"**

### Step 4: Get Webhook Secret

1. After creating the webhook, copy the **"Signing Secret"**
2. It will start with `whsec_` (e.g., `whsec_1234567890abcdef...`)
3. Add this to your Vercel environment variables as `CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET`

### Step 5: Test Webhook

1. Create a test user in your app
2. Check the Vercel function logs to ensure webhook is working
3. Verify user is created in your MongoDB database

## üì± Phone Verification Testing (REQUIRED FOR SMS)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical: Phone Verification Testing

Phone verification is now implemented using **Twilio SMS** instead of Clerk. This provides more control and doesn't require Clerk Pro.

### Step 1: Verify Twilio Configuration

**Ensure these environment variables are set:**

```bash
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=AC...
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=...
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=+1...
```

### Step 2: Test Phone Verification Flow

**After deployment:**

1. **Enable SMS Notifications** in profile settings
2. **Enter phone number** in SMS Phone Number field (client-side validation happens automatically)
3. **Click "Verify"** button to send SMS verification code
4. **Check for SMS** with 6-digit verification code
5. **Phone number** is automatically verified and updated in profile

### Step 3: Monitor Phone Verification

**Check these logs after testing:**

1. **Vercel Function Logs**: Look for phone verification API calls
2. **Twilio Console**: Check SMS delivery logs
3. **Database**: Confirm phone number is saved to user profile
4. **MongoDB**: Check `phone_verifications` collection for verification attempts

### Troubleshooting Phone Verification

**Common Issues:**

1. **"Phone verification failed"**
   - Check Twilio credentials are correct
   - Verify phone number format (+1XXXXXXXXXX)
   - Ensure Twilio account has sufficient credits

2. **"SMS not received"**
   - Check Twilio phone number is valid
   - Verify destination phone number format
   - Check Twilio console for delivery errors
   - Ensure Twilio account is not in trial mode (upgrade required)

3. **"Invalid phone number format"**
   - Phone numbers must be in E.164 format (+1XXXXXXXXXX)
   - 10-digit US numbers are automatically formatted
   - International numbers must include country code

### Success Criteria

- [ ] ‚úÖ Phone verification API endpoint working (`/api/user/verify-phone`)
- [ ] ‚úÖ Twilio SMS delivery successful
- [ ] ‚úÖ SMS notifications can be enabled
- [ ] ‚úÖ Phone numbers can be verified via SMS
- [ ] ‚úÖ Verified phone numbers update user profile automatically
- [ ] ‚úÖ Phone verification works without "Save Changes" click
- [ ] ‚úÖ Verification codes expire after 10 minutes

### Database Connection Testing

1. **Test production connection**
   - Verify MongoDB connection works from Vercel
   - Check connection logs in Vercel dashboard
   - Test database operations through your deployed app

2. **Database Collections Verification**

   Verify these collections exist and are accessible:
   - `users`
   - `restaurants`
   - `collections`
   - `groups`
   - `decisions`
   - `friendships`

3. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Monitor database connection counts
   - Check for slow queries
   - Set up alerts for connection issues

## üîç Google APIs Post-Deployment Configuration

### Update API Key Restrictions

Now that you have a live URL, update your Google API key restrictions:

1. **Google Places API**
   - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com)
   - Navigate to **APIs & Services > Credentials**
   - Select your API key
   - **Update Application restrictions** to include your live domain:
     - Add `https://your-app.vercel.app` to HTTP referrers (if needed)
     - Or keep as "None" for server-side use
   - Ensure **Places API** is enabled

2. **Google Address Validation API**
   - Update restrictions for your live domain
   - Test API calls from your deployed app
   - Monitor API usage and quotas

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Google Places API Issues

#### Issue: "API keys with referer restrictions cannot be used with this API"

**Cause**: The API key has HTTP referer restrictions but is being used server-side.

**Solution**:

1. Go to Google Cloud Console > APIs & Services > Credentials
2. Click on your API key
3. Under "Application restrictions", change from "HTTP referrers" to "None"
4. Save the changes
5. Wait 5-10 minutes for changes to propagate

#### Issue: Empty search results

**Possible Causes**:

- API key restrictions blocking requests
- Invalid location format
- API quota exceeded
- Places API not enabled

**Debug Steps**:

1. Check API key restrictions (must be "None" for server-side use)
2. Verify Places API is enabled in Google Cloud Console
3. Test with a simple location like "Times Square New York NY"
4. Check API usage in Google Cloud Console
5. Review server logs for error messages

         <Script
           strategy="afterInteractive"
           src={`https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=${GA_MEASUREMENT_ID}`}
         />
         <Script
           id="google-analytics"
           strategy="afterInteractive"
           dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{
             __html: `
               window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
               function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
               gtag('js', new Date());
               gtag('config', '${GA_MEASUREMENT_ID}', {
                 page_path: window.location.pathname,
               });
             `,
           }}
         />
       </>
     );
   }
   ```

3. **Add to Layout** (`src/app/layout.tsx`)

   ```tsx
   import GoogleAnalytics from '@/components/analytics/GoogleAnalytics';

   export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
     return (
       <html>
         <body>
           <GoogleAnalytics />
           {children}
         </body>
       </html>
     );
   }
   ```

### Step 4: Configure Custom Events

Create a helper to track custom events throughout your app:

**Create Analytics Helper** (`src/lib/analytics.ts`):

```typescript
type GAEventParams = {
  action: string;
  category: string;
  label?: string;
  value?: number;
};

export const trackEvent = ({
  action,
  category,
  label,
  value,
}: GAEventParams) => {
  if (typeof window !== 'undefined' && (window as any).gtag) {
    (window as any).gtag('event', action, {
      event_category: category,
      event_label: label,
      value: value,
    });
  }
};

// Predefined event tracking functions
export const analytics = {
  // User events
  trackSignUp: (method: string) => {
    trackEvent({
      action: 'sign_up',
      category: 'User',
      label: method,
    });
  },

  trackSignIn: (method: string) => {
    trackEvent({
      action: 'login',
      category: 'User',
      label: method,
    });
  },

  // Restaurant events
  trackRestaurantSearch: (query: string) => {
    trackEvent({
      action: 'search',
      category: 'Restaurant',
      label: query,
    });
  },

  trackRestaurantView: (restaurantId: string) => {
    trackEvent({
      action: 'view_item',
      category: 'Restaurant',
      label: restaurantId,
    });
  },

  trackRestaurantSave: (restaurantId: string) => {
    trackEvent({
      action: 'add_to_collection',
      category: 'Restaurant',
      label: restaurantId,
    });
  },

  // Group events
  trackGroupCreate: () => {
    trackEvent({
      action: 'create_group',
      category: 'Group',
      label: 'New Group',
    });
  },

  trackGroupJoin: (groupId: string) => {
    trackEvent({
      action: 'join_group',
      category: 'Group',
      label: groupId,
    });
  },

  trackDecisionMade: (algorithm: string, restaurantCount: number) => {
    trackEvent({
      action: 'make_decision',
      category: 'Group',
      label: algorithm,
      value: restaurantCount,
    });
  },

  // Notification events
  trackNotificationEnabled: (type: string) => {
    trackEvent({
      action: 'enable_notification',
      category: 'Notification',
      label: type,
    });
  },

  // PWA events
  trackPWAInstall: () => {
    trackEvent({
      action: 'install_pwa',
      category: 'PWA',
      label: 'Home Screen Install',
    });
  },
};
```

**Usage Example**:

```tsx
import { analytics } from '@/lib/analytics';

// Track restaurant search
const handleSearch = async (query: string) => {
  analytics.trackRestaurantSearch(query);
  // ... search logic
};

// Track group decision
const handleDecision = async (algorithm: string, restaurants: Restaurant[]) => {
  analytics.trackDecisionMade(algorithm, restaurants.length);
  // ... decision logic
};
```

## üîî ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Push Notifications Testing (PRIORITY #1)

**‚ö†Ô∏è MUST BE TESTED IMMEDIATELY AFTER DEPLOYMENT**

Push notifications are fully implemented but **cannot be tested locally** due to iOS security restrictions. This is the **FIRST** thing to verify after deployment.

### Why This Is Critical

**Local Development Issue**:

- ‚ùå Service Workers require HTTPS or localhost
- ‚ùå Testing on `http://192.168.x.x` does NOT work on iOS
- ‚ùå Push API and PushManager unavailable over HTTP on network IPs
- ‚úÖ **Will work in production with HTTPS**

**What We Learned**:

- iOS 16.4+ supports Web Push in Safari (iOS 18.6 confirmed)
- Chrome on iOS uses Safari's WebKit engine (same capabilities)
- Service Worker and PushManager APIs require secure context
- Standalone mode (Home Screen) is required for iOS
- `localhost` is secure, but network IPs (`192.168.x.x`) are not

### Testing Procedure

#### Prerequisites

- [ ] App deployed to Vercel with HTTPS
- [ ] iOS device with iOS 16.4 or later (iOS 17+ recommended)
- [ ] Safari browser on iOS
- [ ] Production URL (e.g., `https://you-hungry.vercel.app`)

#### Step 1: Install PWA on iOS

1. Open **Safari** on your iOS device
2. Navigate to production HTTPS URL
3. Tap **Share** ‚Üí **"Add to Home Screen"** ‚Üí **"Add"**
4. **Close Safari completely** (swipe up and close)

#### Step 2: Open from Home Screen

1. Locate "You Hungry?" icon on Home Screen
2. **Tap the icon** (NOT Safari)
3. Verify standalone mode (no browser UI visible)

#### Step 3: Navigate to Push Test Page

1. On home page, scroll to "üõ†Ô∏è Developer Tools" section
2. Tap **"üîî Push Notifications Test"** button
3. You'll be on `/push-test` page

#### Step 4: Verify Service Worker APIs

Check the Debug Info section should show:

- [ ] ‚úÖ SW in navigator: Yes
- [ ] ‚úÖ PushManager: Yes
- [ ] ‚úÖ Notification: Yes
- [ ] ‚úÖ Display Mode: Standalone
- [ ] ‚úÖ Supported: Yes
- [ ] Subscribe button should be **BLUE** (not gray)

**If any show "No", there's still an issue!**

#### Step 5: Test Push Subscription

1. Tap **"üîî Subscribe to Push Notifications (Full)"** button (blue button)
2. iOS should prompt for notification permission
3. Tap **"Allow"**
4. Should see success message
5. Button should change to show unsubscribe option

#### Step 6: Test Notification Delivery

1. Tap **"üì¨ Send Test Notification"** button
2. A notification should appear on your device
3. Notification should show:
   - Title: "You Hungry? Test"
   - Body: "This is a test notification from your PWA!"
   - App icon

#### Step 7: Test on Additional Platforms

**Android Chrome**:

- [ ] Install PWA
- [ ] Test push subscription
- [ ] Verify notifications appear
- [ ] Test automatic install prompt

**Desktop Chrome/Edge**:

- [ ] Test push subscription
- [ ] Verify notifications
- [ ] Test notification actions (if implemented)

### Expected Results

**iOS Safari (16.4+)**:

```json
{
  "capabilities": {
    "hasServiceWorker": true,    ‚úÖ
    "hasPushManager": true,       ‚úÖ
    "hasNotification": true       ‚úÖ
  },
  "displayMode": {
    "isStandalone": true,         ‚úÖ
    "displayMode": "standalone"   ‚úÖ
  },
  "status": {
    "supported": true,            ‚úÖ
    "permission": "granted"       ‚úÖ (after allowing)
  }
}
```

### Troubleshooting Production

**If Service Worker Still Shows "No" on HTTPS**:

1. Clear Safari cache completely
2. Delete PWA from Home Screen
3. Close Safari
4. Reinstall PWA
5. Open from Home Screen
6. Try again

**If Permission is "Denied"**:

1. Settings ‚Üí Safari ‚Üí Advanced ‚Üí Website Data
2. Find and remove production domain
3. Settings ‚Üí Notifications ‚Üí Find app ‚Üí Allow
4. Reinstall PWA

### What We Implemented

‚úÖ **Push Notification Manager** (`src/lib/push-notifications.ts`):

- Permission handling
- Subscription management
- iOS version detection
- Platform capability checks
- Test notification sending

‚úÖ **React Hook** (`src/hooks/usePushNotifications.ts`):

- Status monitoring
- Subscribe/unsubscribe
- Loading states
- Error handling

‚úÖ **Test Page** (`/push-test`):

- Comprehensive status display
- iOS requirement detection
- Platform-specific warnings
- Basic notification fallback for testing
- Debug information panel

‚úÖ **PWA Explorer** (`/pwa-explorer`):

- Tests 15 PWA capabilities
- Browser detection
- API availability checks

### Key Learnings Documented

**iOS Push Notification Requirements** (from [WebKit blog](https://webkit.org/blog/12945/meet-web-push/) and [iOS 16.4 announcement](https://webkit.org/blog/13878/)):

1. **iOS 16.4+** required (most users on iOS 17+)
2. **Must be added to Home Screen** (standalone mode)
3. **Must open from Home Screen icon** (not browser)
4. **HTTPS required** (or localhost for development)
5. **Safari browser** (Chrome on iOS uses same WebKit engine)

**Platform Differences**:

- **iOS**: Limited features, no action buttons, requires home screen install
- **Android**: Full features, automatic prompts, rich notifications
- **Desktop**: Full features, best for development/testing

**Secure Context Requirements** (from [MDN Push API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Push_API)):

- ‚úÖ `https://` - Always secure
- ‚úÖ `localhost` - Considered secure even on HTTP
- ‚ùå `http://192.168.x.x` - NOT secure on iOS
- ‚ùå `http://` on network IPs - NOT secure on iOS

**Browser Detection**:

- Chrome on iOS: User agent contains `CriOS`
- Safari on iOS: User agent contains `Safari` but not `CriOS` or `Chrome`
- Both use WebKit engine on iOS (same capabilities)

### Success Criteria

- [ ] ‚úÖ Service Workers register on HTTPS
- [ ] ‚úÖ PushManager API available in standalone mode
- [ ] ‚úÖ Notification permissions work
- [ ] ‚úÖ Test notifications deliver successfully
- [ ] ‚úÖ Works on iOS 17+
- [ ] ‚úÖ Works on Android
- [ ] ‚úÖ Works on Desktop
- [ ] ‚úÖ Graceful degradation for unsupported platforms

### Next Steps After Verification

Once push notifications are confirmed working:

1. **Integrate with backend** - Server-side push sending
2. **Create notification templates** - For group decisions, invites, etc.
3. **Add user preferences** - Notification settings
4. **Implement triggers** - Auto-send for app events
5. **Add analytics** - Track notification engagement
