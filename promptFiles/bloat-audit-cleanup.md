- Remove if not actively used
- Update any scripts that reference it

**Verification:**

- [ ] Search for usage: `grep -r "playwright.config.no-auth" .`
- [ ] Check npm scripts for references
- [ ] Decide: keep or remove
- [ ] If removing, update documentation

---

### 9. Example/Temporary Files

**Status:** ❌ Not Started  
**Priority:** LOW  
**Impact:** ~2MB disk, repo clutter

**Files:**

**A. Example Design Files**

```
public/example-design/
├── image copy 2.png
├── image copy 3.png
├── image copy.png
├── image_copy_3.txt
├── image_copy.txt
└── image.png
```

**Action:** Move to `/docs/design-archive/` or delete entirely

**B. Prompt Files** (20 markdown files)

```
promptFiles/
├── completed-items.md
├── pending-items.md
├── in-flight.md
├── [17 other .md files]
```

**Action:**

- Keep if using for AI context
- Consider moving to separate repo or using `.cursorrules`

- **23.5%** faster test execution (1.148s → 0.878s)
- **0.270s** test time saved

**What Was Removed:**

```
✓ src/__tests__/performance.test.tsx (391 lines)
  - useDebounce tests (duplicate)
  - useThrottle tests (duplicate)
  - useStableCallback tests (duplicate)
  - PerformanceMonitor tests (duplicate)
  - Basic placeholder tests (bundle size, render, memory, lazy loading, etc.)
```

**What Was Kept:**

```
✓ src/__tests__/performance-utils.test.ts (517 lines)
  - Comprehensive hook tests (useDebounce, useThrottle, useStableCallback, etc.)
  - 10 utility functions thoroughly tested

✓ src/__tests__/performance-monitoring.test.tsx (474 lines)
  - Comprehensive component tests (PerformanceMonitor, EnhancedPerformanceMonitor)
  - API endpoint tests

- Test files: 3 (performance.test.tsx + performance-monitoring.test.tsx + performance-utils.test.ts)
- Test time: 1.148s
- Lines of code: 1,382 lines across 3 files

**AFTER:**

- Test suites: 3 (admin performance-metrics + 2 consolidated files)
- Performance tests: 51 (14 duplicates removed)
- Test files: 2 (performance-monitoring.test.tsx + performance-utils.test.ts)
- Test time: 0.878s (↓ 23.5%)
- Lines of code: 991 lines (↓ 391 lines, 28% reduction)

**Why Removed:**

- performance.test.tsx contained mostly duplicate tests already covered in the other two files
- useDebounce, useThrottle, useStableCallback: All 3 were tested identically across all 3 files
- PerformanceMonitor component: Tested in 2 files, more comprehensive tests in performance-monitoring.test.tsx
- Remaining "unique" tests were basic placeholders that didn't provide real value:
  - Bundle size test checked 0 < 500KB (always passes)
  - Render performance tested basic div (not meaningful)
  - Memory test wasn't accurate
  - Lazy loading, API, caching tests were trivial

**Time Taken:** 15 minutes  
**Risk Level:** None (all duplicate tests, comprehensive coverage retained)

### Color Contrast Scripts Consolidation - October 14, 2025

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

**Actual Savings:**

- **364KB** disk space saved (456K → 92K scripts directory, 79.8% reduction)
- **9,864 lines** of code removed (10,859 → 995 lines, 90.8% reduction)
- **4 files** deleted (verify-color-contrast.js, verify-card-contrast.js, auto-fix-contrast-issues.js, fix-hardcoded-colors.js)
- **1 shared utilities module** created (eliminates code duplication)
- **Zero code duplication** remaining (all shared functions extracted)

**What Was Removed:**

```
✓ verify-color-contrast.js (220 lines, 5.8K)
  - Redundant WCAG AA verification tests
  - Duplicate color contrast functions

✓ verify-card-contrast.js (219 lines, 5.9K)
  - Card-specific color tests (covered by audit)
  - Duplicate color contrast functions

✓ auto-fix-contrast-issues.js (9,235 lines, 338K!)
  - Generated file by comprehensive-contrast-audit.js
  - Massive disk bloat with hardcoded fixes
  - Now audit provides recommendations instead

✓ fix-hardcoded-colors.js (228 lines, 7.1K)
  - Merged into comprehensive-fix-contrast-issues.js
  - Functionality preserved in shared utils
```

**What Was Created:**

```
✓ scripts/utils/color-contrast-utils.js (217 lines, 6.8K)
  - getLuminance() - Calculate relative luminance
  - hexToRgb() - Convert hex to RGB
  - getContrastRatio() - Calculate WCAG contrast ratios
  - checkCompliance() - Verify WCAG AA/AAA compliance
  - COLOR_REPLACEMENTS - Design system color mappings
  - getDesignSystemColor() - Get replacement colors
```

**What Was Optimized:**

```
✓ comprehensive-contrast-audit.js (462 → 395 lines, 14.5% reduction)
  - Removed generateFixScript() function
  - No longer creates 338KB generated file
  - Provides fix recommendations instead

✓ comprehensive-fix-contrast-issues.js (221 → 109 lines, 50.7% reduction)
  - Now imports COLOR_REPLACEMENTS from shared utils
  - Merged fix-hardcoded-colors.js functionality
  - Cleaner, more maintainable code

✓ setup-color-prevention.js (274 lines, no change)
  - Updated references to use npm run fix-colors
  - Better integration with package.json scripts
```

**Architecture Improvement:**

**BEFORE:**

- 7 scripts with duplicate code
- Same functions copied 3+ times
- 338KB generated file created on every audit
- No clear separation of concerns

**AFTER:**

- 4 lean, focused scripts
- Shared utilities module (DRY principle)
- No generated files (recommendations only)
- Clear architecture:
  - Audit → Find issues
  - Fix → Apply fixes
  - Setup → Prevent future issues
  - Utils → Shared functionality

**Verification:**

- ✅ All scripts load and run without errors
- ✅ Shared utilities work correctly (tested getLuminance, hexToRgb, getContrastRatio)
- ✅ comprehensive-contrast-audit.js scans 242 files successfully
- ✅ comprehensive-fix-contrast-issues.js made 29 valid replacements
- ✅ Production build successful
- ✅ All tests passing (68 tests in utils/hooks)
- ✅ No functionality lost
- ✅ Documentation updated (scripts/README.md)

**Why This Matters:**

- **Maintainability:** Single source of truth for color utilities
- **Performance:** No more 338KB generated files
- **Clarity:** Clear separation between audit, fix, and prevention
- **Quality:** Easier to update and test shared functions
- **Developer Experience:** Cleaner codebase, better documentation

**Time Taken:** 25 minutes  
**Risk Level:** Low (comprehensive testing, no breaking changes)

### Test Artifact Files Removal - October 15, 2025

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

**Actual Savings:**

- **16.2MB** disk space removed (test artifacts + build cache)
- **1 tracked file** removed from git (test-db-connection.js)
- **1 empty directory** removed (tests/skipped/)
- **4 artifact directories** cleaned (coverage/, playwright-report/, test-results/, tsconfig.tsbuildinfo)
- **127 lines** of test code removed (test-db-connection.js)

**What Was Removed:**

```
✓ test-db-connection.js (3.9K, 127 lines)
  - One-time manual MongoDB connection testing script
  - No package.json references
  - Safe to remove

✓ tests/skipped/ (0 bytes)
  - Empty directory
  - Not tracked by git

✓ Generated Artifacts (16.2MB):
  - coverage/ (15MB)
  - playwright-report/ (572KB)
  - test-results/ (4KB)
  - tsconfig.tsbuildinfo (576KB)
```

**Verification:**

- ✅ All tests pass (109 suites, 1355 tests, 6.153s)
- ✅ Production build successful
- ✅ Coverage can be regenerated (npm run test:coverage)
- ✅ .gitignore already properly configured
- ✅ No functionality impacted
- ✅ Git only shows deletion of test-db-connection.js

**Why Removed:**

- **test-db-connection.js:** One-time manual testing script, no longer needed
- **tests/skipped/:** Empty directory with no purpose
- **Generated artifacts:** Should not be committed to git, can be regenerated anytime
- **tsconfig.tsbuildinfo:** Build cache, automatically regenerated by TypeScript

**Important Notes:**

- ✅ .gitignore already covers all artifact directories (coverage/, playwright-report/, test-results/, \*.tsbuildinfo)
- ✅ Coverage regenerated successfully (15MB → 13MB, slightly smaller)
- ✅ All artifacts can be regenerated with standard npm scripts
- ✅ No changes needed to .gitignore (already properly configured)

**Time Taken:** 10 minutes  
**Risk Level:** None (test artifacts and one-time scripts)
