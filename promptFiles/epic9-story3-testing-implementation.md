## Test Scenarios Covered

### Critical Decision Making Scenarios ⭐

1. **Clear Winner**: All voters agree on top choice
   - Expected: First choice wins with clear point margin
   - Verified: Reasoning mentions total points and vote count

2. **2-Way Tie**: Two restaurants tied for highest score
   - Expected: Random selection from tied restaurants
   - Verified: Reasoning mentions "tie between 2 restaurants"

3. **3-Way Tie**: Three restaurants tied with equal points
   - Expected: Random selection from all three
   - Verified: Reasoning mentions "tie between 3 restaurants"

4. **Single Voter**: Only one person votes by deadline
   - Expected: Voter's first choice wins
   - Verified: Decision completes successfully with 1 vote

5. **Diverse Votes**: Everyone chooses different first choices
   - Expected: Weighted scoring determines winner
   - Verified: Correct point calculation (1st=3pts, 2nd=2pts, 3rd=1pt)

6. **Re-voting**: User changes vote before deadline
   - Expected: Latest vote counts, previous discarded
   - Verified: Vote count remains same, rankings updated

7. **Real-time Updates**: Vote counts update live
   - Expected: Vote counter increments immediately
   - Verified: UI reflects current vote count

8. **Random Selection**: Weighted random with 30-day rolling history
   - Expected: Recently selected restaurants have lower weight
   - Verified: Weight decreases after selection
