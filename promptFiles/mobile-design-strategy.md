# Mobile Design Strategy: 3-Phase Implementation Plan

## 📋 Overview

This document outlines the complete implementation strategy for Epic 5 Stories 1, 1a, and 1b of the You Hungry? app. The strategy is designed as three distinct phases with strategic overlap to ensure complete coverage of all planned items while maintaining logical progression and development efficiency.

### **Epic 5 Context**

- **Story 1**: Mobile UI Optimization - mobile-first responsive design, touch interactions, mobile navigation patterns
- **Story 1a**: Design System Migration & Legacy UI Updates - neumorphic design system, component migration, dark/light mode
- **Story 1b**: Enhanced Animations & Interactions - Framer Motion integration, micro-interactions, gesture-based interactions

### **Current State**

The app currently has:

- Basic design system with infrared accent colors (outdated)
- Traditional header navigation (needs bottom navigation)
- Limited mobile-first responsive design
- Basic UI components (Button, Input, Card) that need neumorphic migration
- No animation system or Framer Motion integration

### **Target State**

The app will have:

- Sophisticated neumorphic design system with monochrome + infrared accents
- Mobile-first responsive design with bottom navigation and floating action button
- System preference detection (dark/light mode)
- Smooth animations and micro-interactions
- Touch-optimized interactions and gesture-based navigation
- Premium, polished user experience

- Phase 2 must be completed before Phase 3 can begin
- Each phase builds on the previous one
- Strategic overlap is allowed where dependencies permit

### **Risk Mitigation**

- Each phase builds on a stable foundation
- Issues in one area don't cascade to others
- Easier to rollback if problems arise
- Comprehensive testing at each phase

### **Quality Assurance**
