# You Hungry? App - Project Overview

## üéØ Core Concept

**You Hungry?** is a mobile-first web application designed to solve the eternal question: "What should we eat tonight?" Born from the constant conversation between spouses about where to order food, the app helps users organize their favorite restaurants and make collaborative decisions with friends and family.

### The Problem

- Users forget about restaurants they wanted to try
- Difficulty organizing restaurants by mood/hunger level
- Group decision-making is time-consuming and often results in indecision
- No system to track what's been eaten recently to avoid repetition

### The Solution

A comprehensive restaurant management and decision-making platform that:

- Organizes restaurants into customizable collections
- Enables both individual and group decision-making
- Tracks eating history to prevent recent repeats
- Provides multiple decision methods (tiered voting, random selection)
- Supports both personal and social use cases

## üèóÔ∏è App Architecture

### User Flows

The app supports two main user flows:

#### 1. Authenticated Users

- **Personal Collections**: Create and manage personal restaurant collections
- **Social Features**: Add friends and create groups for collaborative decisions
- **Decision Making**: Use tiered voting or random selection algorithms
- **History Tracking**: View past decisions and eating patterns

#### 2. Unauthenticated Users

- **Restaurant Search**: Browse and search restaurants without saving
- **App Discovery**: Learn about the app's features and benefits

## üçΩÔ∏è Core Features

### Personal Collections

- Create custom-named collections (e.g., "To try when I'm alone", "When I'm really hungry")
- Add restaurants to multiple collections
- Prevent duplicate restaurants within the same collection
- Custom restaurant fields: Price Range ($-$$$$) and Time to Pick Up (minutes)

### Group Management

- Add friends by email/username
- Create groups with custom names and descriptions
- Admin privileges for group management
- Members can add restaurants to group collections

### Decision Making

Two decision methods available:

#### Tiered Choice System

- Each member ranks their top 3 choices
- Majority vote determines selection
- Tie-breaking with member choice or random selection
- Re-ranking if no consensus after first round

#### Random Selection

- Weighted selection based on 30-day rolling history
- Choose from all collections or specific collections
- Exponential weighting (recently chosen restaurants have lower chance)
- Minimum chance for all restaurants to ensure variety

### History & Analytics

- Track all decisions (personal and group)
- 30-day rolling weight system
- Manual entry for decisions made outside the app
- Separate weighting for personal vs group decisions
- Group decisions appear in individual history with "group" label

## üîë Required Setup

### API Keys & Services

- **MongoDB Atlas**: Cluster connection string and database name
- **Clerk**: API keys for authentication and webhook secret
- **Google Places API**: For restaurant search and data
- **Google Address Validation API**: For address verification
- **Twilio**: Account SID, Auth Token, and phone number (SMS notifications)

### Database Collections

- `users` - User profiles and preferences
- `restaurants` - Restaurant data and metadata
- `collections` - Personal and group food collections
- `groups` - Group information and memberships
- `decisions` - Historical decision records
- `friendships` - Friend relationships

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Database
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/you-hungry?retryWrites=true&w=majority
MONGODB_DATABASE=you-hungry

# Authentication (Clerk)
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...  # Optional for development

# Google APIs
GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY=AIza...
GOOGLE_ADDRESS_VALIDATION_API_KEY=AIza...

# Twilio (SMS)

```

### MongoDB Setup Clarification

- **MONGODB_URI**: The full connection string to your MongoDB Atlas cluster
- **MONGODB_DATABASE**: The specific database name within the cluster (e.g., "you-hungry")
- The cluster can contain multiple databases, but we'll use the "you-hungry" database for this project
