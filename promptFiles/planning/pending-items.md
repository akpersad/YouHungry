## üé® UI/UX Design Considerations (Future)

### Collection Selection UI (Epic 3+)

- **Current Implementation**: Collections show as buttons when ‚â§3, dropdown when >3
- **Future Challenge**: When groups are introduced, we'll need to distinguish between:
  - Personal collections (user's own)
  - Group collections (shared with friends)
  - Group collections by specific groups
- **Proposed Solution**: Consider implementing:
  - Grouped sections in dropdown (Personal Collections, Group Collections)
  - Visual indicators (icons, colors) to distinguish collection types
  - Search/filter functionality within collection selection
  - Recent collections or favorites at the top
- **Note**: This is a future consideration for Epic 3+ when group features are implemented

## üìù Notes

- Items are organized by priority and estimated effort
- High priority items should be completed first
- Medium priority items can be worked on in parallel
- Low priority items should be evaluated based on user feedback
- Backlog items should be reviewed regularly and promoted based on value
- All items should maintain the mobile-first, PWA-ready architecture
- Cost optimization should be considered for all API integrations
