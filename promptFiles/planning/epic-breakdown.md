# Epic Breakdown - You Hungry? App

This document outlines the major epics and user stories for the You Hungry? app development journey. Each epic represents a major functional area that must be completed sequentially.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Status Tracking

**DO NOT UPDATE THIS FILE WITH COMPLETION STATUS CHANGES**

This file should remain a static reference for the planned epics and stories. Status updates should be tracked in:

- `completed-items.md` - For completed work
- `in-flight.md` - For work currently in progress
- `pending-items.md` - For planned work not yet started

This file is for planning and reference only, not for tracking progress.

## üöÄ Future Technology Integration

**Future technologies** (marked with "Future" in story titles) are strategically placed within epics where they provide the most value:

- **Epic 1**: Enhanced development tools (Husky, lint-staged, Bundle Analyzer) ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
- **Epic 2**: Form management (React Hook Form + Zod), API state management (TanStack Query) ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
- **Epic 4**: Drag & drop ranking (@dnd-kit)
- **Epic 5**: Animations and interactions (Framer Motion)
- **Epic 6**: Toast notifications (Sonner)
- **Epic 9**: Error boundaries and graceful error handling + Performance benchmarking
- **Epic 10**: GraphQL integration (Apollo Server + Client)

**üìä Performance Benchmarking Note**: Performance benchmarking has been moved to Epic 9 (Polish & Optimization) to establish baselines before implementing advanced technologies like GraphQL. This ensures we have proper metrics to measure the effectiveness of optimizations.

These technologies will be implemented when they solve specific problems in each epic, ensuring they add real value rather than being added prematurely.
