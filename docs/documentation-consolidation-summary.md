## Net Impact

- **Files Removed**: 24
- **Files Created**: 3
- **Files Enhanced**: 5
- **Net Reduction**: -21 files

## Information Preserved

### For iOS Migration

**Architecture Patterns**:

- Multi-channel notification orchestrator
- Privacy-preserving analytics (hashed user IDs)
- Conditional polling/refresh strategies
- Optimistic updates with rollback
- Request deduplication and throttling
- 30-day rolling weight algorithm
- Webhook-based authentication sync

**Platform Equivalents Documented**:

- Clerk → Sign in with Apple
- VAPID/Web Push → APNs + UserNotifications
- Service Worker → URLCache + Background fetch
- TanStack Query → Combine + Core Data
- GA4 (gtag.js) → Firebase Analytics SDK
- Web Vitals → MetricKit + Firebase Performance

**Critical Implementation Learnings**:

- WCAG AA color contrast values (25 verified combinations)
- Module-level side effects prevention (test hanging issue)
- Phone number E.164 formatting
- SMS consent compliance requirements
- Deep linking with callback URLs
- Registration data flow (form → auth → webhook → database)

### For Ongoing Development

**Quick References**:

- Analytics tracking functions (50+ events)
- SEO checklist and tools
- Vercel Analytics setup
- Common development commands
- Environment variable reference

**Feature Documentation**:

- Google Analytics 4 implementation
- Epic 8 features (history, weights, analytics)
- Error tracking system
- Performance baselines
- Notification system architecture

## What Was Eliminated

- Duplicate quick reference content (consolidated into one)
- Redundant implementation summaries (merged into features-implemented.md)
- Temporary/one-time audit results (key findings preserved)
- Verification checklists (integrated into pre-deployment)
- Historical notes that don't impact future development
