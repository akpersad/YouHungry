## üé® Technical Architecture

### Database Schema

All decision tracking uses the existing `Decision` collection with enhanced support for:

- Manual decision entries (method: 'manual')
- Weight tracking through result.weights
- Group and personal decision separation
- Visit date tracking for accurate history

### GraphQL Integration

Extended GraphQL schema with:

**Types:**

- `PersonalAnalytics`, `GroupAnalytics`
- `RestaurantWeightInfo`, `WeightsResponse`
- `DecisionHistoryItem`, `DecisionHistoryResponse`
- `PaginationInfo`

**Queries:**

- `getPersonalAnalytics`
- `getRestaurantWeights(collectionId)`
- `getDecisionHistoryFiltered(filters)`

**Mutations:**

- `createManualDecision(input)`
- `resetWeights(input)`

**Subscriptions:**

- `analyticsUpdated(userId)`
- `weightsUpdated(collectionId)`

### Export Utilities

New utility functions in `/src/lib/export-utils.ts`:

- `exportToCSV(data, filename)` - CSV export with proper escaping
- `exportToJSON(data, filename)` - JSON export with formatting
- `exportToText(content, filename)` - Text file export

## üß™ Testing

Comprehensive test suites created:

- `history.test.ts` - 8 test cases covering filtering, pagination, search
- `manual.test.ts` - 6 test cases covering personal/group entries
- `weights.test.ts` - 4 test cases covering weight queries and resets

All tests include:

- Authentication verification
- Validation testing
- Error handling scenarios
- Edge cases (404s, 403s, invalid inputs)

## üìä Key Features
