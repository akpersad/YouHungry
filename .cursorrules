## /stage-commit

Please stage and commit all unstaged files. Group commits into logical groupings; not one big commit.

Instructions:

1. First, check the git status to see what files have been modified
2. Analyze the changes and group them by:
   - Feature/functionality (e.g., all changes related to a specific feature)
   - File type/area (e.g., documentation, tests, components, utilities)
   - Purpose (e.g., bug fixes, new features, refactoring, styling)
3. For each logical group:
   - Stage only those files using `git add`
   - Create a clear, descriptive commit message following conventional commit format
   - Commit the group
4. Continue until all changes are committed
5. Provide a summary of all commits made
